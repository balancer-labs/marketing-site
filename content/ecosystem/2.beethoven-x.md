“Central to the core capabilities of Balancer V2 lies the Protocol Vault. Unlike other DEXs that manage assets across multiple contracts on their protocol, Balancer V2 incorporates a single Vault that holds and manages ALL of the assets across ALL of the pools.

This unique innovation in Vault architecture provides the backbone for a number of novel capabilities and is the basis for how Balancer V2 seamlessly integrates liquidity provision that is 1: flexible, 2: efficient and 3: secure.”
