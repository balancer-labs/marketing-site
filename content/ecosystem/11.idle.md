## About

Idle is a decentralized protocol and DAO that steps up DeFi by reimagining risks and yields.

Since 2019, a vast range of liquidity providers - from DAO treasury managers and institutional players to individuals - have been using Idle to maximize capital efficiency and tailor their risk exposure to their needs.

Idle offers a wide and diversified set of single-sided strategies based on leading DeFi protocols, all featuring automatically compounded interest and no locking periods. There are two core products:

1. [Perpetual Yield Tranches](https://docs.idle.finance/products/perpetual-yield-tranches) are an innovative primitive that splits a single yield source into two risk/return profiles:
    - Junior Tranches are designed for risk-on users, as they offer no coverage on funds, but provide boosted yields;
    - Senior Tranches are designed for risk-averse users, as they feature built-in protection on deposits (given by the Junior class’ deposits)

2. [Best Yield vaults](https://docs.idle.finance/products/best-yield) are automated strategies which combine multiple yield sources and programmatically route funds in the best performing market to always provide the highest yield available. 
    - Junior BY vaults combine multiple Junior Tranches, allowing to automate an aggressive approach and offer significantly higher APYs
    - Senior BY vaults combine Aave, Compound, and multiple Senior Tranches, allowing to maintain a conservative risk profile while maximizing returns

## How it uses Balancer protocol

Idle is a core partner of Balancer and the first yield aggregator protocol integrated into Balancer’s Generalized Boosted Pools.

In the [Idle Boosted 3Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x60683b05e9a39e3509d8fdb9c959f23170f8a0fa000000000000000000000489) - the first released product - funds are actively used for trades on Balancer and deployed into Idle’s Junior Best Yield vaults, unlocking superior returns.
