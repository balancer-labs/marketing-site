## About

Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.

## How it uses Balancer protocol

Aave is a core partner of the Balancer protocol with many joint projects like Boosted Pools and their 80/20 AAVE/ETH Safety Incentive pool.

“Part of what makes DeFi so exciting is its composability, and with Balancer this has resulted in a partnership that optimises the experience for liquidity providers through the use of Balancer Aave Boosted Pools and opens up new possibilities for Aave stakers with the AAVE/ETH Safety Incentive pool. We look forward to exploring more synergies with Balancer in the future.”
